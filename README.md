Physics Equation Blackboard
==================
## Inspiration &#x1F4DA;&#x269B;
Physics has always intrigued me as one of the most fascinating subjects during my school years. Its unique concepts and the exploration of natural phenomena have continuously captivated my curiosity. While the subject revolves around the comprehension of nature matters, Mathematics also plays a vital role in calculating complex relationships and predicting  outcomes of the universe. As a student, I've come to appreciate the convenience of having an accessible digital calculator to solve equations and formulas of math and science subjects.

## What this project does &#x1F30C;&#x1F320;
**Physics Equation Blackboard** is a website designed for calculating variables in physics formulas, covering topics such as mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. The website features a visually soothing green-blue background theme that enhances user comfort and visual experience.

## Why this project is useful &#x1F4D3;&#x1F393;
The Physics Equation Board website provides a convenient solution for solving and checking school homework answers or performing complex calculations with large numbers. The webiste is accessible on both computer and mobile devices and offers a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation. Additionally, it features a comprehensive list of formulas related to various physics topics and displays the units of physics variables measured in the SI system.

## How we built this &#x2699;&#x1F4BB;
The website was built using the Qoom IDE and languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The website is compatible with various devices due to its scalability and simplicity for a smooth user experience. The complete code for the website can be accessed on [GitHub]( https://github.com/phyulwin/HackBytesII-2023), and credits for the background images used are included in the [copyright.txt](https://github.com/phyulwin/HackBytesII-2023/blob/main/copyright.txt) file.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of &#x2B50;&#x1F3D4;
During the development stages, I gained valuable knowledge in JavaScript syntax and the language. Because my limitations in designing and coding in HTML/CSS, I had to extensively study API documentations and utilized external resources like YouTube and W3Schools. Ultimately, I was able to build a functional and educational app that benefits students, including myself.

## What's next for Physics Equation Blackboard &#x1F30E;&#x1F52C;
Upcoming features will include displaying and calculating the values of variables with different units, such as the Metric system, along with unit conversions for SI units. Additionally, the website will include equations from subjects that are currently not covered, such as thermodynamics, fluid statics, fluid dynamics, and more.
